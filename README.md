# About The Project
In this Project we had created a Disease Predictor App which asks users about the symptoms he/she is experiencing on the basis of this our App will predict the disease the user might have with 92% Accuracy. In this App he used Sequential Neural Network Model to predict the Disease and this Model is Trained for 131 symptoms and can predict 40+ Disease with 92% Accuracy and created an Flask App on AWS Server. This Model is Trained for 131 symptoms and can predict 40+ Disease with 92% Accuracy.

# Aim
